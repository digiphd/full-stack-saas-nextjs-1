## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PNPM
- Docker (for local development of Directus CMS)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/digiphd/full-stack-saas-nextjs-1.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Start development servers (including Directus CMS in Docker)
pnpm dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
AUTH_PROVIDER=clerk
QUEUE_PROVIDER=upstash
CMS_ENDPOINT=https://cms.yourdomain.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://app.yourdomain.com
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
NEON_DATABASE_URL=your_neon_db_url
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
```

## üìÑ Development Workflow

### Generate OpenAPI Docs

```bash
pnpm generate:openapi
```

### Local Directus CMS

The Directus CMS runs in a Docker container locally for development. When you run `pnpm dev`, the container will be started automatically.

> **Note**: While the Directus container is fully functional, the integration with blog and marketing pages is still in progress. The frontend currently uses mock data for these sections.

### Current Implementation Status

#### Blog and Marketing Pages
- The blog currently uses hardcoded mock data
- Directus integration is planned but not fully implemented
- Revalidation API routes are set up for future CMS integration

#### Upstash Workflows
- Framework and handlers are set up
- Uses placeholder/mock configurations for local development
- Requires additional configuration for production use

#### Email with Resend
- Fully implemented with proper configuration
- Development mode logs emails instead of sending them
- Ready for production with proper API keys

### Deployment Options

#### Directus CMS Deployment

For production deployment of Directus CMS, you have several options:

- **fly.io**: A cost-effective on-demand service that's easy to set up and scale. Recommended for most use cases.
- **Self-hosted Docker**: Deploy the Docker container to your own infrastructure.
- **Directus Cloud**: Official managed service from Directus (https://directus.cloud).

### Revalidate Pages

After CMS updates, trigger revalidation (once CMS integration is complete):

```bash
curl -X POST https://app.yourdomain.com/api/revalidate?secret=your_secret&path=/blog/your-post-slug
```
